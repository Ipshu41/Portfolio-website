        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Ipshu. I was born and raised in the beautiful valley of Kathmandu, Nepal. I am a fledgling Front-end Developer currently working at WeGolook in Oklahoma City. 
          I started developing an enthusiasm towards the tech-industry during my early high-school days. I graduated in December 2017 with a degree in Computer Science. 
          I am fascinated by this field because it's dynamic and in demand. I am interested in any opportunities that aids me in learning, ameliorating and contributing more in the field of Front-end Development. 
          While Front-end Development is my primary focus, I am up for getting my hands on any prospects that brushes and enhances my technical, interpersonal and leadership skills. 
          I like to call myself an extroverted introvert who loves connecting to new people, participate in group events (basically indulge in multitude of social activities) but also cherish some downtime to cook, binge watch, paint(just for fun)learn new things and travel.
          
          </p>
